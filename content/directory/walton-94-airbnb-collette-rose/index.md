Visit Port Hope's vibrant downtown and stay in the heart of it all. Inspired by a classic Parisian Pied-a-terre, inside
The Colette Rose you will find 12ft ceilings, plaster moulding details, a complete calacatta viola marble shower,
chevron wood floors, and vintage carpets. No detail has been overlooked to bring the most authentic Parisian experience
to your stay.
