Lent Travel was established in 1951 by the Lent family: our location has served as a passenger rail depot for the Port
Hope to Peterborough rail line, telegraph office and travel agency. In 1982 it was purchased by the Beauchamp family and
has been operated by John Beauchamp until the present. John has been active in the community serving on boards for the
YMCA, Northumberland Players and Port Hope United Church as well as an active volunteer with Rebound Youth Services and
the Cobourg Dragon Boat Club. His thirty years of experience has given home a strong background for providing a full
range of leisure and business products for both individuals and groups.
