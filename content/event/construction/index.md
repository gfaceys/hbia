  This project impacts all of us who live and work in downtown Port Hope.  This
  meeting provides us an opportunity to ask questions and get the information we
  need to plan how we work together to survive and thrive. Let's create
  opportunities to help each other.  For those who won't be able to make this
  meeting, we will post a recap here on the HBIA website.
