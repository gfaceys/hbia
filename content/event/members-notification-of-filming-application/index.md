Artists and directors reveling and exploring in our unique and historic downtown, have become part of the business that takes place here in our beautiful streetscape. Due to the writers' strike in the recent past, the filming that started last year could not be completed. The production we have got to know as â€œFairview/Reaper's Image" needs to complete their episode, so some filming needs to take place before construction begins.

Members of the HBIA are notified by the that there is an application for filming to take place downtown on the following dates:

WED March 27th (Evening) Intermittent traffic control/stoppages on Queen Street from the corner of Walton Street to Augusta Street. Stoppages to accommodate production filming inside of The Capitol at 20 Queen Street.

THURS March 28th (Day/Evening) Queen Street to be closed from the corner of Walton Street to Augusta Street to accommodate production filming at The Capitol and placing equipment on Queen Street -- Intermittent stoppages on Walton Street from Mill Street North to Ontario Street (just in order to prevent modern cars from entering the shot passing on Walton when filming on Queen). Intermittent stoppages on sidewalks on Queen Street from Augusta Street to Robertson Street. Intermittent stoppages for Lift equipment to travel safely into place down Queen Street.

Inquiries and feedback from Members of the HBIA is welcome at:  hbia@port-hope.com
