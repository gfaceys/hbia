The Social Bar + Table features refined, rustic cuisine at its best. It concentrates on craft beers and wines of the world. The menu, although small, changes regularly to focus on local food. Everything is scratch-made fresh every day. The Social is a tiny restaurant that has been bursting at the seams since the day it opened.
