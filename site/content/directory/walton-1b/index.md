A minute's walk from the Capitol Theatre, this historic Heritage District hotel, dating from 1845 and overlooking the Ganaraska River, is also 10 minutes' walk from Port Hope VIA train station. Elegant rooms feature custom-built cherry or mahogany furnishings, and period features such as high ceilings and large windows. All have either river or street views, and come with high-speed Internet access, TVs and Keurig coffeemakers. Some offer fireplaces, and upgraded rooms add terraces. There's a buzzy Italian restaurant which marries classic and modern styles. It's open for brunch, lunch and dinner.
