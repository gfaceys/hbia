Ross Funeral Chapel is the oldest business in Port Hope, and certainly one of the earliest surviving establishments in Canada, if not North America, to be situated in its original buildings. In fact, this firm has been providing services to the people of Port Hope and surrounding area since before the confederation of our country.
